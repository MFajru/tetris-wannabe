# CLASSIC TETRIS
This is my personal project to make classic tetris using HTML and JS.

## How To Play
- Open this link http://tetris-wannabe.vercel.app/ on desktop or mobile.
- If you are in desktop, move the tetromino block with arrow keys (left and right). If you are in mobile, move the tetromino block with the given left and right button on the screen.
